# Superhero-Game
This is a basic 2D game made with Unity to get familiar with proper game making workflow and efficiency. The game is a simple 2D side-scroller where players control a superhero to avoid buildings and helicopters.

Note: This project's asset, prefab and scene files are all visible and usable with GitHub! To enable this feature in Unity go to Edit>Project Settings>Editor and under the Version Control Mode section set it to "Visible Meta Files".

We are looking for artists and musicians! Any good sound effects, background music or sprites/animation are greatly appreciated!

Although we are not actively looking for help in programming or game development feel free to fork this project and mess around with it. If you do add something cool we might be able to add it. Just remember to make a "Pull Request" from your fork and we will check it out!
